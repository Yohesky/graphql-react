## Description

This project is organized using a feature-based architecture, applying SOLID principles and common design patterns to keep the code modular, maintainable, and scalable.

Each feature contains its own UI, logic, types, and API layer, reducing coupling between modules. The structure promotes clean separation of concerns and makes it easier to introduce new functionality without affecting existing areas of the codebase.
